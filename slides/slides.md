# Do Frontend Devs dream of Backend functions?

## reactjsday @ Verona - October 25th 2024

<!--
Hello everyone. This is the last talk before lunch, so I will do my best to stay in perfect time. And if you will have any question, please feel free to stop me during the lunch.

Before we start, let me ask you three questions.

# Who code in node.js?

<!--
Ok, the last one: keep your hand raised if you code backend servers in node.js with a complexity a bit higher than a CRUD application

Ok ok, enough. -->

# React, where are we going?

<!--
As we all have seen in the last couple of years, we're moving into a new future for web applications. Do you know what I'm talking about?
We are leaving the browser's kingdom and we start coding backend functions. Isn't it?
We all know that the evolution of any technology begins slowly and then accelerates rapidly.

# The React evolution

<v-clicks>

  - React open sourced - May 2013
  - React 50k stars on Github - September 2016
  - React hooks - February 2019
  - Zero-Bundle-Size React Server Components - December 2020
  - React 18 with renderToStream - March 2022
  - Next.js 14 with App Router - October 2023
  - React 19 - ???

</v-clicks>

<!--
I feel the same is happening with React.
Our journey started in May 2013 when React was released open source.
- In 3 years it reached 50k stars on github, which was an amazing result! And they made the celebrative shirts
- ...

In the last 2 years, the library and our way of making web application got a new direction.

# The evolution of <br />client-server communication

We started with PHP application with HTML rendered on the server, then we invented the SPA

One year ago the React Server Component appeared, and as you already saw in the previous talk, they are just async functions rendered only on the server.

The approach is similar to pipeableStream, but in this case a RSC payload is release by the function. (click)

On our client, everytime we need to render a react server component, we must ask to the server to render it.

# New render strategies

<!--
[12:00]
We saw the state of react rendering paradigms. And like small bricks, all those new paradigms allow us to build multiple ways to render every single piece of our application
-->

---

# All-or-nothing

<div class="flex justify-center items-center h-full p-8">
  <img src="./assets/static-dynamic-chart1.svg" class="h-full" />
</div>

<!--
If before we had to decide what kind of render strategy we would like to implement as templating for our web application or website...
-->

---

# Multi-paradigm

<div class="flex justify-center items-center h-full p-8">
  <img src="./assets/static-dynamic-chart2.svg" class="h-full" />
</div>

<!--
... now with React we can use the same technology for a multiple-paradigm render strategy.
Let's see an example
-->

---

# Multi-paradigm

<div class="flex justify-center items-center h-full p-8">
  <img src="./assets/static-dynamic-01.svg" class="h-full" />
</div>

<!--
We started with a binary decision: I can do my website statically generated, and call the api server on the browser to fetch the cart and the user sessions.
This make the search engines happy, the users happy, but it's good for stale data for long time.
-->

---

# All-or-nothing

<div class="flex justify-center items-center h-full p-8">
  <img src="./assets/static-dynamic-02.svg" class="h-full" />
</div>

<!--
Or, we could make it dynamic. I know the user's session handling the request, I prepare their own response and send it.
They hydration will finish the work on the browser.
-->

---

# Multi-paradigm

<div class="flex justify-center items-center h-full p-8">
  <img src="./assets/static-dynamic-03.svg" class="h-full" />
</div>

<!--
But now, compounding multiple paradigms in the same codebase, I can decide what kind of rendering I want for each specific slice of my application.

I can generate a static shell of my page with some placeholders, I can stream dynamic data as soon as they are ready.
For example to show the cart quantity icon.
And finally I can fetch additional less relevant data on the client.

All of this, nearly chosen component by component.

If you want to start making this choices, we saw all the small bricks you need to start making your own render strategy for your application.

# Partial Pre-Rendering

<!--
But if you want to give a try on this, Partial Pre-Rendering is a Next.js feature based on this approach.

Using Next.js 14 and laters , you can enable the experimental flag in the NextConfig.

Then, on the page you want to make it faster, export the const experimental_ppr.
This will produce a new _prerendered as static HTML with dynamic server-streamed content_ page.

# Granular caching

- Static files / chunks
- Static pages
- Static pages' shells
- Data fetching
- Server-side computation

<!--
Multiple layer of rendering means multiple ways to cache data. Caching static-generated pages, or a data fetching result, or using memoization on computed component can boost our application more than ever.

# Granular caching

</div>

</div>

<!--
For example, we ask to compute query or calculations and keep it cached for 5 seconds.

We prepare the promise and we assign the promise when the component is called the first time.
Once the promise is resolved, it will stay resolved until someone will clear the cache.

unstable_noStore is just a way to tell Next.js to don't store this page as static.

Ok, this works. But please, do not this in production. It's just for study

# Granular caching

  const details = await fetchPlaneDetails(id);
  // ...
}

Ref. https://nextjs.org/blog/our-journey-with-caching

<!--
Ok, Bonus track. I added this one tonight.

To keep an eye on the future, yesterday at Next.js Conf 24 the new directive "use cache" has been announced.
This will be allowed in pages, single components and single functions and will cache the results.

# New communication abstraction

<!--
[17:00] Let's talk about "use server" and "use client".

# Server Actions

<!--
Add `'use server'` at the top of an async function body to mark the function as callable by the client. We call these functions _Server Actions_. (click)

This means we run server-side code just invoking a function. (click)

Technically speaking, they are converted into API functions called with fetch on events.

In this case, we have a server components, with a server function and really few bytes of javascript bundle.

<!--
Let's talk about server actions. We have our a server action, called in a form action.

We said that function will be encapsulated into an API call, invoked over the network.
To pass data over the network, what do we need? To serialize data.

But not everything is serializable of course. The point is we are not used to have a function in a file, invoked few lines below that instead is an api call under the hood.

Then, let's focus on that bind.

Changing the parameter for the API call, we should be able to delete messages for all users.

And we are lucky if we'll lost only messages.

By the way, even this time it's not just a constructed example..

The point is not React Server Components, or Server Actions, are not secure. But just we're facing new problems derived from new paradigms.

<!--
Let's close with this.
All those abstraction layer are used to split our application in multiple small services. The static files and the static pages delivered on the edge, middlewares on the edge workers, serverless functions for server actions and server components.

This is an amazing chart of the all services under the hood, that I've taken from a company that maybe you don't know.

But what if we want to host our web application on our cloud?

# Final thoughts

- Modern frameworks' gold rush
- Complex and powerful render paradigms made easy
- Incredible UXs

- Fullstack frameworks mean fullstack problems
- Instability of experimentation
- Infrastracture complexity, sometimes out of controls

<!--
- Modern frameworks are growing fast in every possible direction
- Moving complexity from frontend to backend and viceversa enables us to ship incredible user experiences
- ... but also introduces a new kind of _fullstack_ problems to face, and everything is running so fast.

I feel the ecosystem is like startups: fail fast and breaking things.

# Final thoughts

> ### Here's what is new in Next.js 15:
>  - @next/codemod CLI: Easily upgrade to the latest Next.js and React versions.
>  - Async Request APIs **(Breaking)**: Incremental step towards a simplified rendering and caching model.
>  - Caching Semantics **(Breaking)**: fetch requests, GET Route Handlers, and client navigations are no longer cached by default.
>  - ...

<!--
My fear is that, except if you have a big team of software engineers dedicated to platform or R&D, follow this instability and change our application everytime a new iteration has been released can cost more than benefit we get.
